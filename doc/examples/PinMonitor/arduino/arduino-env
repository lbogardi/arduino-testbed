#   You can either source this file from the command line manually, or you can
#   include it in your ~/.bashrc file.
#
#   NOTE: The below example settings are based on a general Ubuntu
#   installation. YMMV.

#   Installation directory of Arduino
export ARDUINO_DIR=/usr/share/arduino

#   Installation directory of the Arduino-Makefile by sudar
#   -   See https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile
export ARDMK_DIR=/usr/share/arduino

#   The full path for the Arduino-Makefile
#   -   This is just a convenience variable, so we can simply say
#       "include $(ARDUINO_MK)" in our Makefile.
export ARDUINO_MK=$ARDMK_DIR/Arduino.mk

#   Installation directory of the AVR tools
export AVR_TOOLS_DIR=/usr

#   The full path of the avrdude confiugration file
export AVRDUDE_CONF=/usr/share/arduino/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf
